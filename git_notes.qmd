## Basics of using git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is very popular.

The cores steps to using git involve 

1. Initiate a git repository 
    In RStudio we just click a little radio button on project creation
    At the command line we type
    `git init`
    
2. Do your normal work
    Add files
    Modify files etc.
    
3. Add your important files to the "stage"
    In RStudio we click "staged" radio button
    `git add yourfilename`
    
4. Commit your staged files to the repository
    In RStudio you just hit the "commit" button and add a msg
    `git commit -m "your message or comment"`
    
You can check your project "history" and status
    `git  status`
    `git log` (push Q to exit)
